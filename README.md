Libert wouldn't have been the same without [@leovarmak](http://twitter.com/leovarmak) and [@kbrsh](http://kabir.ml)

## Disclaimer

All libert does is fetch books from gen.lib.rus.ec, with a different UI. It is designed to make using the source easier, and does not host anything itself. I, Samarth Jajoo, claim no responsibility for any materials hosted at the source.
